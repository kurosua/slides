** Inspiration for this lab comes from the work of Jonathan Tannen 

## Goals for Today   

1. Dummy regression.  
2. Interactions.  
3. Presenting results.  

## “UN Data on Life Expectancy.”  {.smaller}

- Load the dataset from Fox:  
- http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Applied-Regression-2E/dataset/UnitedNations.txt  
- More info on dataset: http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Applied-Regression-2E/datasets/UnitedNations.pdf
- Explore the dataset.  
- Make some plots of Life Expectancy. Anything interesting?  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
df <-read.table("http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Applied-Regression-2E/datasets/UnitedNations.txt")
df$country <- rownames(df)
rownames(df) <- NULL
df <- tbl_df(df)
df
```

## Male and Female Life Expectancy

1. Describe the difference between Male and Female Life Expectancy using statistics.
2. Describe the difference between Male and Female Life Expectancy visually. (Challenge yourself to keep adding information!)
3. Describe the difference between Male and Female Life Expectancy by region using statistics. (What kind of variable is ‘region’?)
4. Add region information to your plot.
5. Challenge: Redo the plot, but try adding the country names instead of points.

## Comparing Regions 

1. Create a dummy for European countries.  
2. Create a dummy for non-European countries. 
3. Regress female life expectancy on the europe dummy. Regress female life expectancy on the non-europe dummy. What do you notice?  
4. Regress female life expectancy on ‘region’. Interpret the results.  
5. Challenge: Do Europe and America have the same mean female life expectancy?  

## Life Expectancy and GDP

1. Plot female life expectancy and female education (with region colors). 
2. Regress female life expectancy on female education. Interpret the results. Plot the regression line. 
3. Regress female life expectancy on female education and the Europe dummy. Interpret each. Plot the regression lines.
4. Regress female life expectancy on female education, only for European countries. Plot the regression line.    
5. Regress female life expectancy on female education, only for American countries. Plot the regression line.   
6. Regress female life expectancy on female education, Europe, and the interaction between the two. Plot the regression lines.


## Life Expectancy and GDP

Ambitious:  

- Regress female life expectancy on female education and all region dummies. Interpret each.    
- Regress female life expectancy on every region dummy interacted with female education.  Interpret every term.  
- Put this information on your scatter plot. (Think hard about the most intuitive way to present it!)
