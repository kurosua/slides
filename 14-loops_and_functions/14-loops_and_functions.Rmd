##  Goals for Today

1. Understand why abstraction is helpul 
2. Use for loops.
3. Create a function.

## Rules for Abstraction by Gentzkow and Shapiro (2014)

1. Abstract to eliminate redundancy.
2. Abstract to improve clarity.
3. Otherwise, donâ€™t abstract

"Abstraction is essential to writing good code for at least two reasons. First ... it eliminates redundancy, which reduces the scope for error and increases the value you can get from the code you write. Second, just as importantly, it makes code more readable. A reader scanning one of the three code blocks above might easily miss their purpose. By contrast, a call to a function called leaveout_mean is hard to misunderstand" p.(24)

## "Advances in Development Reverse Fertility Declines" {.smaller}

- The paper examined the relationship between the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Total Fertility Rate (TFR).    
- Download: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/extref/nature08230-s2.zip    
- Open a new R Script, set it up, and read.csv the data. We will only be using 2005 data today.   
- Install the package "MASS" with "install.packages("MASS")" and load the MASS, dplyr, boom, and ggplot2 packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("MASS") 
library(MASS)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(broom)
df <- read.csv("data/nature08230-s2.csv")
df <- select(df, country, HDI.2005, TFR.2005)
df <- filter(df, !is.na(HDI.2005), !is.na(TFR.2005))
df <- tbl_df(df)
df
```


## Linear Regression

- Make a scatter plot of TFR and HDI for 2005.
- Regress TFR on HDI in 2005.
- Add the regression line to your plot.   
- Draw a sample of 100 coefficients from this distribution (using
mvrnorm(), from package MASS). This involves using 'vcov' which gives variance-covariance of the coefficients (more on this on Wednesday).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vcov(lfit)

mvrnorm(1, mu = lfit$coefficients, Sigma = vcov(lfit))

```




## Introduction to loops {.smaller}

Example from The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design by Normal Matloff  
  
- for (n in x){  
  
- "This means that there will be one iteration of the loop for each component of the vector x, with n taking on the values of those components - in the first iteration, n = x[1]; in the second iternation, n = x[2]; and so on." (p. 140)


```{r}
x <- c(5, 12, 13)
for (n in x){
  print( n ^ 2)
}

```

## Introduction to loops 

```{r}
for (i in 1:10){
  print("Hello world!")
  print(i*i)
}

```


## Introduction to loops {.smaller}

- If you want to store the values that you create in a vector, you need to set up a vector OUTSIDE OF YOUR LOOP to store the values in before starting your loop. (ex. sqr.squared <- NULL)    

https://blog.udemy.com/r-tutorial/

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sqr <-  seq(1, 100, by=2) # generating sequences of 50 numbers
head(sqr)
sqr.squared <- NULL  ## setting up empty vector
for (n in 1:50) {
sqr.squared[n] <- sqr[n]^2
}

head(sqr.squared)
head(cbind(sqr, sqr.squared))
```


## Practicing for Loops
- Make a scatter plot for TFR and HDI for 2005 using the "plot()"" function 
- Add a line to your scatter plot with the first set of sampled coefficients using "abline()."
(Make it general, rather than typing the coefficients into your script by hand).
- Use a for loop to repeat the above command for every pair of coefficients.

## Introduction to functions {.smaller}
- Basic set up for functions:
- function.name <- function(arguments) {  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purpose of function (i.e. computations involving the arguments)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }  
- "{" indicates the beginning of the function, "}" the end
http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/library/intro_function.htm  
```{r}

# Creating a function, called f1, which adds a pair of numbers.
f1 <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

f1(3, 4)
f1(2, 6)
```


## Introduction to functions {.smaller}

- Basic set up for functions:
- function.name <- function(arguments) {  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purpose of function (i.e. computations involving the arguments)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }  

```{r}

my.scatter.plot <- function(color, size = 2, method) { # set default size to 2
  ggplot(df, aes(x = HDI.2005, y =  TFR.2005)) + 
    geom_point(color = color, size = size) +   # color and size vary based on inputs
    geom_smooth(method = method, color = "red") + # line will always be red
    theme_bw()                                    # theme will always be bw
}

# my.scatter.plot(color = "green", size = 6,  method = "lm")
# my.scatter.plot(color = "blue",  method = "lm")
# my.scatter.plot("red", 5, "loess")

```

## functions {.smaller}

- Recall the linear model ( lfit() ) and 100 draws of coefficients (sample.coefs)
- Now, write a set of commands that calculates the RMSE for the first pair of coefficients. (There are many steps! You need to calculate predicted values, then find residuals, then calculate RMSE)
- We will want to perform these steps many times, so now make this a function.
- ONLY AFTER YOU'VE WRITTEN YOUR OWN:
Matt has provided a sample function at
https://gist.github.com/jtannen/5026444

- *For more on RMSE see http://www.theanalysisfactor.com/assessing-the-fit-of-regression-models/
